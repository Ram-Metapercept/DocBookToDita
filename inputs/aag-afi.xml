<para role="ps_indent_0">This AICPA Audit Guide has been developed
by the AICPA publications team to assist practitioners in performing
and reporting on their audit engagements.</para>
<para role="ps_indent_0">An AICPA guide containing auditing guidance
related to generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) is recognized
as an interpretive publication, as defined in AU-C section 200B,<footnote id="aag-afi_preface_fn1" label="fn 1" role="number">
<para>Each AU-C section in this guide designated with a “B” suffix
(for example, “AU-C section 200B”) denotes content that does not reflect
the codification of SAS Nos. 134–140 or the amendments to other SASs
made by SAS Nos. 134–140 and subsequently issued SASs. </para>
<para><tab/>All AU-C sections can be found in AICPA <olink targetdoc="ps" targetptr="ps"><emphasis role="italic">Professional
Standards</emphasis></olink>.</para>
</footnote> <emphasis role="italic">Overall Objectives of the Independent
Auditor and the Conduct of an Audit in Accordance With Generally Accepted
Auditing Standards</emphasis>. Interpretive publications are recommendations
on the application of GAAS in specific circumstances, including engagements
for entities in specialized industries.</para>
<para role="ps_indent_0">Interpretive publications are issued under
the authority of the AICPA Auditing Standards Board (ASB) after all
ASB members have been provided an opportunity to consider and comment
on whether the proposed interpretive publication is consistent with
GAAS. The members of the ASB have found the auditing guidance in this
guide to be consistent with existing GAAS.</para>
<para role="ps_indent_0">Although interpretive publications are not
auditing standards, AU-C section 200B requires the auditor to consider
applicable interpretive publications in planning and performing the
audit because interpretive publications are relevant to the proper
application of GAAS in specific circumstances. If the auditor does
not apply the auditing guidance in an applicable interpretive publication,
the auditor should document how the requirements of GAAS were complied
with in the circumstances addressed by such auditing guidance.</para>
<para role="ps_indent_0">Throughout this guide, when appropriate,
reference is made to Technical Questions and Answers, which are considered
other auditing publications. AU-C section 200B indicates that in applying
the auditing guidance included in an other auditing publication, the
auditor should, exercising professional judgment, assess the relevance
and appropriateness of such guidance to the circumstances of the audit.
Other auditing publications have no authoritative status; however,
they may help the auditor understand and apply GAAS. The auditor is
not expected to be aware of the full body of other auditing publications.
Although the auditor determines the relevance of these publications
in accordance with paragraph .28 of AU-C section 200B, the auditor
may presume that other auditing publications published by the AICPA
that have been reviewed by the AICPA Audit and Attest Standards staff
are appropriate. These other auditing publications are listed in <olink targetdoc="ps" targetptr="ad_appendix_f">AU-C appendix F</olink>, <emphasis role="italic">Other Auditing Publications</emphasis>.</para><?Pub Caret 732?>
<para role="ps_indent_0">The ASB is the designated senior committee
of the AICPA authorized to speak for the AICPA on all matters related
to auditing. Conforming changes made to the auditing guidance contained
in this guide are approved by the ASB chair (or his or her designee)
and the director of the AICPA Audit and Attest Standards staff. Updates
made to the auditing guidance in this guide exceeding that of conforming
changes are issued after all ASB members have been provided an opportunity
to consider and comment on whether the guide is consistent with existing
GAAS.</para>
<para role="ps_indent_0">AICPA Guides may include certain content
presented as “supplement”, “appendix”, or “exhibit.” A supplement
is a reproduction, in whole or in part, of authoritative guidance
originally issued by a standard-setting body (including regulatory
bodies) and applicable to entities or engagements within the purview
of that standard setter, independent of the authoritative status of
the applicable AICPA Guide. Both appendixes and exhibits are included
for informational purposes and have no authoritative status.</para>
<para role="ps_indent_0">Any auditing guidance in a guide appendix
or exhibit (whether chapter or back matter appendix or exhibit), though
not authoritative, is considered an “other auditing publication.”
In applying such guidance, the auditor should, exercising professional
judgment, assess the relevance and appropriateness of such guidance
to the circumstances of the audit. Although the auditor determines
the relevance of other auditing guidance, auditing guidance in a guide
appendix or exhibit has been reviewed by the AICPA Audit and Attest
Standards staff and the auditor may presume that it is appropriate.</para>

<para role="ps_indent_0">This edition of the guide has been modified
by AICPA staff to include certain changes necessary due to the issuance
of authoritative guidance since the guide was originally issued, and
other revisions as deemed appropriate. Authoritative guidance issued
through September 1, 2020, has been considered in the development
of this edition of the guide. However, this guide does not include
all audit, accounting, reporting, regulatory, and other requirements
applicable to an entity or a particular engagement. This guide is
intended to be used in conjunction with all applicable sources of
relevant guidance.</para>

on or before September 1, 2020, is incorporated directly in the text

September 1, 2020, but becoming effective on or before December 31,
2020, is also presented directly in the text of the guide, but shaded
gray and accompanied by a footnote indicating the effective date of
the new guidance. The distinct presentation of this content is intended
to aid the reader in differentiating content that may not be effective
for the reader’s purposes (as part of the guide’s “dual guidance”
treatment of applicable new guidance).</para>
<para role="ps_indent_0">Relevant guidance issued but not yet effective
as of the date of the guide and not becoming effective until after
December 31, 2020 is referenced in a “guidance update” box, that is,

<para role="ps_indent_0">Any requirements described in this guide
are normally referenced to the applicable standards or regulations

describing the professional requirements of the referenced standard

standards or regulations (for example, <emphasis>must</emphasis> or <emphasis>should</emphasis>). However, where the accounting requirements are
derived from FASB ASC, this guide uses <emphasis>should</emphasis>, whereas FASB uses <emphasis>shall</emphasis>. In its resource document
“About the Codification” that accompanies FASB ASC, FASB states that
it considers the terms “should” and “shall” to be comparable terms
and to represent the same concept—the requirement to apply a standard.</para>
<para role="ps_indent_0">Readers should refer to the applicable standards
and regulations for more information on the requirements imposed by
the use of the various terms used to define professional requirements

rules, particularly in those circumstances in which the guide describes
prevailing or preferred industry practices for the application of
a standard or regulation. In these circumstances, the applicable senior

declined, then the underlying mortgages in a security may experience
higher prepayment rates than originally expected. Estimating potential
default and loss reserve involves close evaluation of the underlying
collateral and borrowers to estimate default rates. For example, when
the underlying collateral comprises residential mortgages, loss reserves
may be affected by estimates of residential housing prices over the

important contextual information about the characteristics of the

</footnote> Obtaining an understanding of the entity and its environment,
including the entity’s internal control, is a continuous, dynamic
process of gathering, updating, and analyzing information throughout
the audit. The understanding obtained enables the auditor to identify
and assess the risks of material misstatement at the financial statement
and assertion levels, thereby providing a basis for designing and
implementing responses to the assessed risks of material misstatement.
The volume and variety of the financial instrument transactions of
an entity typically determine the nature and extent of controls that
may exist at an entity. An understanding of how financial instruments
are monitored and controlled assists the auditor in determining the
nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures.</para>

significantly increasing the risk of material misstatement because
they would be undertaken outside the system of internal control. To
mitigate this risk, an entity will often establish a clear policy
regarding what transactions can be traded by whom, and adherence to
this policy will then be monitored by an entity’s administrative and
support services. Monitoring trading activities of individuals (for
example, by reviewing unusually high volumes or significant gains
or losses incurred) will assist management in ensuring compliance

information systems generally keep track of financial instrument activities
and are designed to ensure that settlements occur when due. More complex
computer systems may generate automatic postings to clearing accounts
to monitor cash movements, and controls over processing are put in
place with the objective of ensuring that financial instrument activities
are correctly reflected in the entity’s records. Computer systems
may be designed to produce exception reports to alert management to
situations when financial instruments have not been used within authorized
limits or when transactions undertaken were not within the limits
established for the chosen counterparties. However, even a sophisticated
computer system may not ensure the completeness of the recording of
financial instrument transactions. Accordingly, management frequently
puts additional procedures in place to increase the likelihood that
all transactions will be recorded.</para>

For example, if supporting documentation, such as derivative contracts

another auditor to visit the service organization to inspect the documentation.
Also, if investment advisers, holders of financial instruments, recordkeepers,

financial instruments, it may not be practicable or possible for the
user auditor to obtain an understanding of the user entity’s internal

Use of a Service Organization Affects the Auditor’s Considerations
in Auditing Financial Instruments," of this guide discusses the effect
on the auditor’s consideration of the risk of material misstatement
of financial statement assertions about financial instruments if one
or more service organizations provides financial instrument services
to the entity under a discretionary arrangement. Those discussions
address the following two types of situations:</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet" role="ps_indent_2">
<listitem><para>Two separate service organizations. In this situation,
one service organization initiates transactions as an investment adviser,
and a second service organization holds and services the financial
instruments. The auditor may corroborate information provided by the
two organizations. For example, the auditor may confirm holdings with
the holder of the financial instruments and apply other substantive
procedures to transactions reported by the user entity based on information
provided by the investment adviser. Depending on the facts and circumstances,
the auditor also may confirm transactions or holdings with the investment
adviser and review the reconciliation of differences. </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>One service organization. In this situation, one service
organization initiates transactions as an investment adviser and also
holds and services the financial instruments. All the information
available to the auditor is based on one service organization’s information.
Therefore, the auditor may have to obtain evidence about the operating
effectiveness of the service organization’s controls. The auditor
may be unable to obtain an understanding of the user entity’s internal
control over financial instrument transactions; assess the risk of
material misstatement for financial statement assertions about financial
instruments; and design and perform further audit procedures, including
substantive audit procedures, to address those risks without obtaining
audit evidence about the operating effectiveness of relevant service
organization controls. An example of such controls is establishing
independent departments that provide the investment advisory services
and the holding and servicing of financial instruments, then reconciling
the information about the financial instruments provided by each department.</para>

these SASs in light of the effect of the coronavirus pandemic. SAS

amended the auditor reporting model adopted in SAS No. 134 with the

so that these SASs would be implemented as a suite, primarily to accommodate
the amendments to the auditor reporting model. Accordingly, the ASB
recommends that all of these SASs be implemented concurrently. SAS

valuation assertions about them ill-suited to testing via analytical
procedures. Additionally, the accounting for many financial instruments

Finally, the accounting for financial instruments may be highly dependent

been properly recognized in the financial statements or in evaluating
the fair value of a financial instrument whose value fluctuates greatly.
However, they may be effective in pointing out unrecorded derivatives,
such as interest rate swaps that contractually require no cash at
inception. For example, a difference from an expectation that interest
expense will be a fixed percentage of a note based on the interest
provisions of the underlying agreement may indicate the existence
of an interest rate swap agreement. Also, analytical procedures based

the absence of a material difference from an expectation that interest
income will be a fixed percentage of a debt security based on the
effective interest rate when the entity purchased the security provides
evidence about the existence of the income (and the security). However,
auditors might consider that the income, expenses, gains, and losses
associated with a financial instrument may involve a complex interplay
of many factors. For example, if the fair value of a derivative is
derived from the interrelationship of exchange rates, interest rates,
rate differentials, or a combination of these, any attempts to develop

of the process used by the investor entity’s management to determine
estimated fair value is an important element in support of the resulting

audit procedures. The auditor may test management’s fair value estimate
as of the balance sheet date by using one or more of the following
approaches. The approach(es) taken may not be the same for all alternative
investments in an investor entity’s portfolio because the nature of
the underlying investments and associated risk, as well as the information
available to management and the auditor, likely will be different
for each alternative investment. The higher the assessed risk of material
misstatement, the greater the need for the auditor to utilize a combination
of the following approaches:</para>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="italic">Confirm the alternative investment</emphasis>. If the auditor determines that the nature and extent of auditing
procedures should include testing the measurement of the investor
entity’s investment, simply receiving a confirmation from the alternative
investment of the entity’s investments in financial instruments, either
in aggregate or on a security-by-security basis, does not, in and
of itself, constitute sufficient appropriate audit evidence in addressing
the valuation assertion. The extent of the additional audit procedures
is directly related to the assessed risk of material misstatement
of the financial statements.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="italic">Review and test the investor
entity’s significant assumptions and the underlying data in its valuation
or analysis of the assumptions and data obtained from the fund manager</emphasis>. A confirmation on a security-by-security basis may provide support
of the data used by the investor’s management in its valuation process.
In drafting a confirmation, the auditor may consider requesting a
description of each investment, ownership percentage or shares owned,
and estimated fair value. If detailed information is not available,
the auditor may look to the other data that management used in its
valuation and perform tests on such data. The nature of the tests
depends on the types of data used by management and the auditor’s
assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements.</para>
</listitem>

statements as of the same date</emphasis>. If audited financial statements
of the alternative investment are available as of the date of the
investor entity’s year-end, and the alternative investment follows
fair value accounting, the audited financial statements and an accompanying
auditor’s report may provide significant audit evidence regarding
the valuation of the investment. However, the investor entity and
fund often have different fiscal year-ends. In lower- or moderate-risk
situations, the auditor might be able to obtain the fund’s audited
financial statements as of the fund’s fiscal year-end and perform
(or arrange to have the fund’s auditor perform) additional procedures
to test the transactions and changes in fair value between the fund’s
fiscal year-end and the investor’s fiscal year-end.</para></listitem>

investment as of a date close to the investor entity’s fiscal year-end,
may provide information for management to support the valuation of
the alternative investment. The auditor may consider how often settlements
occur and the terms used to determine the value of the settlement.
Issues to consider include whether the process used for the settlement
is the same process used for financial reporting; whether there are
holdbacks or potential true-ups subsequent to the balance sheet date;
and the possibility that the parties to the transactions were not
both willing buyers and sellers, such as in a distress sale.</para>

sufficient information to record the investments at estimated fair

in circumstances may lead to a move from valuation by market price
to valuation by model or may result in a change from one particular
model to another. Reacting to changes in market conditions may be
difficult if management does not have policies in place prior to their
occurrence. Management may also not possess the expertise necessary
to develop a model on an urgent basis or select the valuation technique
that may be appropriate in the circumstances. Even when valuation
techniques have been consistently used, a need exists for management
to examine the continuing appropriateness of the valuation techniques

Further, valuation techniques may have been selected in times when
reasonable market information was available, but that information
may not provide reasonable valuations in times of unanticipated stress.</para>

<para role="ps_para_number">The susceptibility to management bias,
whether intentional or unintentional, increases with the subjectivity
of the valuation and the degree of measurement uncertainty. For example,
management may tend to ignore observable marketplace assumptions or
data and instead use its own internally-developed assumptions if those
assumptions yield more favorable results. Even without fraudulent
intent, there may be a natural temptation to bias judgments toward
the most favorable end of what may be a wide spectrum rather than
the point in the spectrum that might be considered to be most consistent
with the applicable financial reporting framework. Changing the valuation
technique from period to period without a clear and an appropriate
reason for doing so may also be an indicator of management bias. Although
some form of management bias is inherent in subjective decisions relating
to the valuation of financial instruments, when there is intention
to mislead, management bias is fraudulent in nature.</para>

lacks the sophistication to perform its own valuation. For example,
an acquiring entity may refuse to engage a valuation specialist and

appropriate audit evidence to provide a reasonable basis for forming
an opinion. There are often significant challenges to management obtaining
sufficient information to support its assertions relevant to financial
instruments, and auditors will face similar challenges in obtaining
audit evidence and evaluating its sufficiency. The amounts and types
of audit evidence necessary to support an opinion are matters for
the auditor to determine in the exercise of his or her professional

audit evidence, the auditor may consider whether the specific audit

a publicly traded copper mining company at its $800,000 face amount.
The intent of BEV’s management was to invest in a relatively stable
security that would be available to finance BEV’s plant expansion

classification is changed becomes the bond’s new cost basis. With
the exception of a decline in fair value that is other than temporary,
changes in the fair value of the bond after the change in classification
should only be recognized when they are realized. However, any decline

with the requirements of paragraphs 34A–34E of FASB ASC 320-10-35.
The measurement of the decline in value (impairment) should not include
partial recoveries after the balance sheet date. The fair value of
the bond would then become the new cost basis and should not be adjusted
for subsequent recoveries in fair value. However, the amortized cost
basis should be adjusted for accretion and amortization as discussed
in FASB ASC 320-10-35-35.</para>

component of equity (such as accumulated other comprehensive income).
However, it is treated as a premium or discount and amortized over
future years as a yield adjustment. The bond’s amortized cost basis,
which is its carrying amount, is its $800,000 face amount less the

will be its face amount. In financial statements after the reclassification,
BEV’s financial statements should disclose, among other things, the

<para role="ps_para_number">The $150,000 unrealized holding loss related
to the bond at the time of the reclassification would continue to
be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Each year,
BEV will receive $48,000 in cash from the issuer of the bond, which
is 6% of the bond’s $800,000 face amount. An effective interest rate
of 11.08393% would discount 5 annual payments of $48,000 and an $800,000
principal payment at the end of the fifth year to the bond’s $650,000
carrying amount when the classification is changed. Accordingly, the
difference between the result of applying this rate to the bond’s
carrying amount and the $48,000 stated interest should be recorded
as amortization of the discount. As the following table illustrates,
the substance of the accounting is that each year, cash increases
$48,000; the bond’s carrying amount increases by the discount amortization;
and equity increases by the result of applying 11.08393% to the carrying
amount of the bond at the beginning of the year:</para>

bicycles. Recently, BEV hired a new controller who came to the entity
with five years of experience in public accounting. During the years
of BEV’s growth, the owners of the entity became less involved with
the daily operations of the business, and the reliability of controls
suffered. One of the first tasks of the new controller was to design
and implement a more formal system of internal control that emphasized
segregation of duties and strong oversight and monitoring of all accounting
functions by supervisors. Included in this formal system is the requirement
that one of BEV’s owners personally review the month-end investment
statements sent by the broker-dealer who holds and services the bond.
These documents are then sent to the accounting department for entry
into the accounting system. Based largely on the improvements made
by the new controller, the auditor determined that BEV’s control environment
is well-designed and capable of mitigating control risk.</para>

<para role="ps_para_number">At the date of reclassification from available

of the bond to its <emphasis role="italic">fair value</emphasis>,
as defined by FASB ASC 820, <emphasis role="italic">Fair Value Measurement</emphasis>, through a charge to other comprehensive income and a credit to
the carrying amount of the bond. The unrealized loss at that date
should be amortized over the remaining life of the bond as a discount,
thereby increasing the carrying amount of the bond over the remaining
life of the bond so that it equals the bond’s face amount when the
bond matures. The loss charged to other comprehensive income should
continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income
but amortized over the remaining life of the bond through credits
to other comprehensive income in amounts equal to the discount amortization.
As a result of this accounting, each year, BEV will report in earnings
interest at the bond’s 6% stated rate and other comprehensive income
equal to the discount amortization.</para>

<para role="ps_para_number">As discussed in paragraph .A7 of AU-C
section 402B, the significance of the controls at the service organization
to the user entity’s internal control also depends on the degree of
interaction between the service organization’s activities and those
of the user entity. The degree of interaction refers to the extent
to which a user entity is able to and elects to implement effective
controls over the processing performed by the service organization.
For example, a high degree of interaction exists between the activities
of the user entity and those at the service organization when the
user entity authorizes transactions, and the service organization
processes and accounts for those transactions. In these circumstances,
it may be practicable for the user entity to implement effective controls
over those transactions. On the other hand, when the service organization
initiates or initially records, processes, and accounts for the user
entity’s transactions, a lower degree of interaction exists between
the two organizations. In these circumstances, the user entity may
be unable to or may elect not to implement effective controls over
these transactions at the user entity and may rely on controls at
the service organization. In this arrangement, when the broker-dealer
both initiates and executes trades, the broker-dealer provides all
the information about trades that is available to the auditor. In
addition, the broker-dealer’s initiation and execution services are
largely provided electronically. Accordingly, the auditor concludes
that audit risk cannot be limited sufficiently without obtaining the
following audit evidence about the operating effectiveness of the
broker-dealer’s controls:<footnote id="aag-afi8_fn6" label="fn 6" role="number">

when multiple service organizations are used, such as an investment

independent records, the user auditor may confirm balances with these

on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis
and available for sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized
cost basis, FASB ASC 326 eliminates the probable initial recognition
threshold in current generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of
all expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation
account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial
assets to present the net amount expected to be collected.</para>
<para>For available for sale debt securities, credit losses should
be measured in a manner similar to current GAAP. However, FASB ASC
326 will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather
than as a write-down. ASU No. 2016-13 affects entities holding financial
assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at
fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities,
trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet credit
exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets
not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive
cash. This also changed guidance in FASB ASC 325-40, which is related

<para role="ps_para_number">The convertible bonds are hybrid financial
instruments that are a combination of straight interest-bearing bonds
and a conversion option. Because the option affects the value of the
bonds in a manner similar to a derivative, Martin must analyze the
hybrid instrument against the three criteria set out in FASB ASC 815-15-25-1.<footnote id="aag-afi9_fn5" label="fn 5" role="number">
<para>Because Larson’s equity securities are publicly traded, the
option that requires physical delivery of those shares would generally
be considered net settleable because the shares are readily convertible
into cash. As discussed in FASB ASC 815-10-15-18, if the shares were
not readily convertible into cash (for example, because they are privately
held), the option would not be considered net settleable and, therefore,
would not be a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of
FASB ASC 815, <emphasis role="italic">Derivatives and Hedging</emphasis>, if freestanding.</para>

derivative that must be accounted for separately from the straight

<para role="ps_para_number">To check the reasonableness of its estimate
of the option’s fair value, Martin imputed the yield to maturity (YTM)
on the straight bonds. Assuming that the bonds have 8 years and 2
months to maturity, the imputed YTM on them is 12.54%. If Larson had
straight bonds outstanding, Martin could compare the imputed YTM with
the YTM of those bonds. However, Larson has no straight bonds outstanding,
so Martin compared the imputed YTM to the YTM on straight bonds of
similar credit quality (that is, BBB rated), which is approximately
12.5% to 13%. Therefore, Martin concluded that the allocation of the

is an interest rate swap. <emphasis role="italic">Swaps</emphasis> are contracts to exchange, for a period of time, the investment
performance of one underlying instrument for the investment performance
of another instrument without exchanging the instruments themselves.
The interest rate swap used in this case study involves the swap of
interest at a variable rate based on a designated benchmark interest
rate (in this case study, 90-day London Interbank Offered Rate [LIBOR])
multiplied by a notional principal amount for interest at a fixed
rate multiplied by that same notional principal amount. </para>

<para role="ps_para_number">Under the agreement in this case study,
the entity effectively pays interest under the swap at a variable
rate and receives interest under the swap at a fixed rate (although
the entity actually pays or receives only the net amount under the
swap). In this particular case, the notional amount of the swap is
the same as the principal outstanding under the entity’s bond, and
the fixed rate received under the swap is the same as the bond’s rate.
Accordingly, the amount of fixed-rate interest received under the
swap equals the amount of interest paid on the bond, and the net amount
of interest paid equals the interest paid under the swap at the variable
rate. The swap therefore enables the entity to pay a variable rate
of interest on the amount of principal outstanding under the bond,
thus effectively converting the bond from a fixed-rate to variable-rate
instrument.</para>

<para role="ps_para_number">In order to meet the criteria for hedge
accounting, the hedge must be highly effective. When certain conditions
are met, the entity may assume that an interest rate swap will be
completely effective in hedging benchmark interest rate risk. In that
situation, the entity may elect to use the shortcut method discussed
in paragraphs 102–117 of FASB ASC 815-20-25, thereby avoiding the
need to formally assess hedging effectiveness at inception and on
a continuing basis. In this case study, one of those conditions is
not met because the interest rate swap matures one month later than
the bond obligation.</para>

<para role="ps_para_number">JLM’s fixed-rate bond obligation together
with the interest rate swap it entered into is economically equal
to a variable-rate obligation as a result of entering into the interest
rate swap. For example, interest expense for the quarter ended June
30, 20X1, was $21,250, consisting of $20,000 paid under the bond plus
$1,250 paid under the swap. This equals interest on the bond at the
variable rate of 8.5% ($1,000,000 × 8.5% × 3/12 = $21,250). Due to
the fact that the benchmark interest rate increased during the first
5 months of the hedging relationship, the fair value of the interest
rate swap decreased, resulting in JLM making net interest cash payments
on the settlement dates. </para>

the change in the fair value of the bond obligation attributable to

value of the foreign currency rises relative to the functional currency,
the entity simply will not exercise its option and can lose no more

For example, a firm continually assesses client relationships to comply
with relevant ethical requirements, including independence, integrity,
and objectivity, and policies and procedures related to the acceptance
and continuance of client relationships and specific engagements.
Similarly, the human resources element of quality control encompasses
criteria related to professional development, hiring, advancement,
and assignment of firm personnel to engagements, all of which affect
policies and procedures related to engagement performance. In addition,
policies and procedures related to the monitoring element of quality
control enable a firm to evaluate whether its policies and procedures
for each of the other five elements of quality control are suitably
designed and effectively applied.</para>

<para>The <emphasis role="italic">Black-Scholes option pricing model</emphasis> is a mathematical model for estimating the price of options. To

<para>Who uses it?</para>
</entry><entry align="left" colsep="0" nameend="c7" namest="c3" rowsep="1" valign="top">
<para>The Black-Scholes model is not the only model for estimating
the price of options (some others are the Monte-Carlo simulation and
binomial trees); however, Black-Scholes is the best known and most
widely used. Computer versions of this model are widely available,
and virtually any broker who trades options has access to them.</para>

<para>What are the key assumptions?</para>
</entry><entry align="left" colsep="0" nameend="c7" namest="c3" rowsep="1" valign="top">
<para>Strictly speaking, the Black-Scholes model applies only to European-style
options (in which the buyer of the option can exercise the option
only on the expiration date) that pay no dividends. Adjustments should
be made to the model to address other situations.</para>
<para>Of the five variables used in the model, the first three (time
to expiration, strike price, and risk-free interest rate) are easy
to corroborate. The fourth variable — the price of the underlying
stock — also may be easy to verify if the stock is publicly traded.
If the stock is not publicly traded, then its price must be estimated.</para>
<para>Typically, the fifth factor — volatility of the underlying stock
— is the most subjective and difficult to estimate of the five variables.</para>

<para>More about volatility</para>
</entry><entry align="left" colsep="0" nameend="c7" namest="c3" rowsep="1" valign="top">
<para>Price volatility can be viewed in the context of the bell-shaped
curve. In a bell-shaped curve, the mean and median of a population
are at the apex of the curve. The standard deviation describes the
shape of the curve. Approximately 68% of the values in a normal distribution
are within ± 1 standard deviation of the mean, 95% of the values are
within ± 2 standard deviations, and 99.7% of the values are included
within 3 standard deviations. The standard deviation describes 2 factors:
the dispersion of the data and the probability that any specified
outcome will fall within the standard deviation selected. The greater
the standard deviation, the flatter the bell-shaped curve and the
more dispersed the data.</para>
<para><emphasis role="italic">Volatility</emphasis> is nothing more
than the standard deviation of the price of a particular stock. Usually,
it is expressed as a percentage of the stock value. For example, assume
that the stock of XYZ is trading at $40, and its volatility is 20%.
Over the course of 1 year, its trading range would be projected to
be within 20% of its current price approximately 68% of the time.
That is, approximately 68% of the time, the stock would trade between
$32 and $48. Going out to 2 standard deviations, 95% of the time,
the stock would trade between $24 and $56.</para>
<para>Annual volatility can be adjusted to a daily rate. The Black-Scholes
model does this by dividing the annual volatility by the square root
of the number of trading periods. In any year, there are approximately
256 trading days (this excludes weekends and holidays), and the square
root of 256 is 16. To convert an annual volatility rate to a daily
rate, divide it by 16. Thus, if the annual volatility was 20%, the
daily volatility would equal 20% ÷ 16, or 1.25%. In the example of
XYZ Company stock trading at $40 per share, standard deviation on
the first day would be $0.50 ($40 × 1.25%). At the end of the first
day of trading, there is approximately a 68% chance that the value
of the stock will be between $39.50 and $40.50 per share.</para>

<para>Assess the assumed volatility for reasonableness. If the stock
is publicly traded, volatility ordinarily correlates to the historical
price movement of the stock: approximately 68% of the values of the
stock should fall within 1 standard deviation of the median. The auditor
may consider recalculating the volatility assumptions by referring
to historical stock price movements. If the stock is not traded publicly,
compare the assumed volatility with other entities in the same industry.
FASB <emphasis role="italic">Accounting Standards Codification</emphasis> 718, <emphasis role="italic">Compensation — Stock Compensation</emphasis>, requires companies to disclose the volatility used to value employee
stock options, and these disclosures could be a source of information. </para>
<para>Determine how sensitive the estimate of fair value is to changes
in volatility. Ask the entity to run the model several times using
different volatility rates while all other variables are held constant.
This will indicate how sensitive the estimate is to assumptions about
volatility. Evaluate the results of this test in light of materiality.
For example, if large changes in the volatility rate do not produce
a material effect on the financial statements, the auditor may be
able to reduce audit risk to an acceptable level with a minimum of
other test work.</para>
<para>As an alternative to these procedures, the auditor may recalculate
the option price using a different model and assumptions the auditor
deems appropriate.</para>

<para>What are the key assumptions?</para>
</entry><entry align="left" valign="top">
<para>The timing of the cash flows usually is a contractual matter
that will likely be easy to verify. For the zero-coupon method, the
discount rates used are the spot interest rates implied by the current
yield curve for hypothetical zero-coupon bonds due on the date of
each future net settlement on the swap. These rates, too, will likely
be easy to corroborate. Difficulties arise in estimating the amount
of future cash flows.</para>

<para>More about estimating future cash flows.</para>
</entry><entry align="left" valign="top">
<para>Suppose that ABC entered into an agreement to swap payments
on a fixed-rate liability for a variable rate. If interest rates decline,
ABC will receive a net positive cash flow from the swap because the
amount received on the fixed rate will be greater than the amount
due on the variable rate. The opposite is true if rates increase.
Thus, the future net settlements are a function of the future price
of the underlying, in this case, interest rates. The zero-coupon method
simplifies the estimate of future cash flows by calculating the net
settlement that would be required if future interest rates are equal
to the rates implied by the current yield curve. Any changes in the
yield curve are accounted for prospectively.</para>

<para>The audit approach would be the same as for any other present

the estimate of future cash flows.</para>
<para>Of the two, the future cash flows usually have the bigger effect
on the final estimate of fair value.</para>
<para>Understand the assumptions underlying the discount rate and,
to the extent possible, verify the objective elements of this rate.</para>

<para role="ps_indent_0">The objective of FASB’s Accounting for Financial
Instruments project is to significantly improve the decision usefulness
of financial instrument reporting for users of financial statements.
The project was initiated to reconsider recognition and measurement
of financial instruments, address issues related to impairment of
financial instruments and hedge accounting, and increase convergence
in accounting for financial instruments. In replacing existing financial
instruments standards, an expected outcome is the simplification of
accounting requirements for financial instruments. The project was
split into three phases: classification and measurement, impairment,
and hedge accounting. This appendix focuses on the latest developments
in each of these phases.</para>

of amounts previously written off and expected to be written off should
be included in the valuation account and should not exceed the aggregate
of amounts previously written off and expected to be written off by

projections of future interest rate environments when using a discounted

financial instruments. Furthermore, an entity that uses projections
or expectations of future interest rate environments in estimating
expected cash flows should use the same assumptions in determining
the effective interest rate used to discount those expected cash flows.
The amendments also clarify that if an entity uses projections of
future interest rate environments when using a discounted cash flow

instruments, it also should adjust the effective interest rate to
consider the timing (and changes in the timing) of expected cash flows
resulting from expected prepayments.</para></listitem>

ASC 326-20 and on available-for-sale debt securities within the scope
of FASB ASC 326-20 to appropriately isolate credit risk in determining
the allowance for credit losses. Furthermore, an entity should not
adjust the effective interest rate used to discount expected cash
flows for subsequent changes in expected prepayment if the financial
asset is restructured in a TDR.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="italic">Consideration of estimated
costs to sell when foreclosure is probable.</emphasis> The amendments
clarify the guidance in FASB ASC 326-20-35-4 by specifically requiring
that an entity consider the estimated costs to sell if it intends
to sell rather than operate the collateral when the entity determines
that foreclosure on a financial asset is probable. Additionally, when
an entity adjusts the fair value of collateral for the estimated costs
to sell, the estimated costs to sell should be undiscounted if the
entity intends to sell rather than operate the collateral.</para>

<para role="ps_indent_0">In some cases, current GAAP contains limitations
on how an entity can designate the hedged item in a fair value hedge
of interest rate risk. In other cases, current GAAP contains limitations
on how an entity can measure changes in fair value of the hedged item
attributable to interest rate risk in certain fair value hedging relationships.
Those limitations may not align with an entity’s risk management strategies
or the way in which interest rate risk can be hedged in the cash flow
hedging model. To resolve those issues, the amendments in this ASU
change the guidance for designating fair value hedges of interest
rate risk and for measuring the change in fair value of the hedged
item in fair value hedges of interest rate risk. Specifically, the
amendments:</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet" role="ps_indent_2">
<listitem><para>Permit an entity to measure the change in fair value
of the hedged item on the basis of the benchmark rate component of
the contractual coupon cash flows determined at hedge inception, rather
than on the full contractual coupon cash flows as required by current
GAAP.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Permit an entity to measure the hedged item in a partial-term
fair value hedge of interest rate risk by assuming the hedged item
has a term that reflects only the designated cash flows being hedged.
Current GAAP does not allow this methodology when calculating the
change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to interest
rate risk.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>For prepayable financial instruments, permit an entity
to consider only how changes in the benchmark interest rate affect
a decision to settle a debt instrument before its scheduled maturity
in calculating the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable
to interest rate risk.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>For a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets
or one or more beneficial interests secured by a portfolio of prepayable
financial instruments, permit an entity to designate an amount that
is not expected to be affected by prepayments, defaults, and other
events affecting the timing and amount of cash flows (the "last-of-layer"
method). Under this designation, prepayment risk is not incorporated
into the measurement of the hedged item.</para></listitem>

<title role="ps_subsub_heading">Recognition and Presentation of the
Effects of Hedging Instruments</title>
</sectioninfo>
<para role="ps_indent_0">The amendments in this ASU also align the
recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument
and the hedged item in the financial statements to increase the understandability
of the results of an entity’s intended hedging strategies.</para>
<para role="ps_indent_0">The amendments in this ASU require an entity
to present the earnings effect of the hedging instrument in the same
income statement line item in which the earnings effect of the hedged
item is reported. This presentation enables users of financial statements
to better understand the results and costs of an entity’s hedging
program. Also, relative to current GAAP, this approach simplifies
the financial statement reporting for qualifying hedging relationships.
The amendments in this ASU require the following recognition and presentation
guidance for qualifying hedges:</para>
<itemizedlist mark="bullet" role="ps_indent_2">
<listitem><para>For fair value hedges, the entire change in the fair
value of the hedging instrument included in the assessment of hedge
effectiveness is presented in the same income statement line that
is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. The timing
of recognition of the change in fair value of a hedging instrument
included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is the same as under
current GAAP, but the presentation of hedge results could change because
current GAAP does not specify a required presentation of the change
in fair value of the hedging instrument.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>For cash flow and net investment hedges, the entire
change in the fair value of the hedging instrument included in the
assessment of hedge effectiveness is recorded in other comprehensive
income (for cash flow hedges) or in the currency translation adjustment
section of other comprehensive income (for net investment hedges).
Those amounts are reclassified to earnings in the same income statement
line item that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged
item when the hedged item affects earnings. The timing of recognition
of the change in fair value of a hedging instrument could change relative
to current GAAP because hedge ineffectiveness no longer is recognized
currently in earnings. The presentation of hedge results also could
change because current GAAP does not specify a required presentation
of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument in the income
statement.</para></listitem>

<para role="ps_indent_0">Current GAAP permits an entity to exclude
option premiums and forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
The amendments in this ASU continue to allow an entity to exclude
those components of a hedging instrument’s change in fair value from
the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Additionally, the amendments
permit an entity to exclude the portion of the change in fair value
of a currency swap that is attributable to a cross-currency basis
spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.</para>
<para role="ps_indent_0">For all types of hedges, if an entity excludes
certain portions of a hedging instrument’s change in fair value from
the assessment of hedge effectiveness (excluded component), the amendments
permit an entity to recognize in earnings the initial value of the
excluded component using a systematic and rational method over the
life of the hedging instrument. If an entity elects this method, any
difference between the change in fair value of the excluded component
and amounts recognized under the systematic and rational method is
recognized in other comprehensive income, whereas for net investment
hedges, the difference is recognized in the cumulative translation
adjustment section of other comprehensive income. An entity also may
elect to recognize all fair value changes in an excluded component
currently in earnings, consistent with current GAAP.</para>
<para role="ps_indent_0">For fair value and cash flow hedges, an entity
should present amounts related to excluded components that are recognized
in earnings in the same income statement line item that is used to
present the earnings effect of the hedged item. For net investment

excluded components.</para>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="italic">Partial-term fair value hedges
of interest rate risk.</emphasis> The amendments clarify that an entity
may measure the change in fair value of a hedged item using an assumed
term only for changes attributable to interest rate risk. They also
clarify that an entity may measure the change in the fair value of
the hedged item attributable to interest rate risk using an assumed
term when the hedged item is designated in a hedge of both interest
rate risk and foreign exchange risk. In that instance, the change
in carrying value of the hedged item attributable to foreign exchange
risk must continue to be measured based on changes in the spot exchange
rate in accordance with FASB ASC 815-25-35-18. In addition, the amendments
clarify that one or more separately designated partial-term fair value
hedging relationships of a single financial instrument can be outstanding
at the same time, and for forward-starting partial-term fair value
hedges, the issuance of the hedged item is assumed to occur on the
date in which the first hedged cash flow begins to accrue.</para>

hedge basis adjustments.</emphasis> The amendments clarify that an
entity may, but is not required to, begin to amortize a fair value
hedge basis adjustment before the fair value hedging relationship
is discontinued. If an entity elects to amortize the basis adjustment
during an outstanding partial-term hedge, that basis adjustment should
be fully amortized by the hedged item’s assumed maturity date in accordance
with FASB ASC 815-25-35-13B.</para></listitem>

the analysis supporting a last-of-layer hedge designation concurrently
with hedge inception. Not-for-profit entities (except for not-for-profit
