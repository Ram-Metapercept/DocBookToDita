financial instruments, including embedded derivatives, are often measured
at fair value for the purpose of balance sheet presentation, calculating
gain or loss, or disclosure. In general, the objective of fair value
measurement is to arrive at the price at which an orderly transaction
to sell an asset or transfer a liability would take place between
market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions
(that is, at an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective
of the market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability).
In meeting this objective, all relevant available market information
is taken into account.</para>

        Fair value measurements of financial assets
and liabilities may arise both at the initial recording of transactions
and later when there are changes in value. Changes in fair value measurements
that occur over time may be treated in different ways under different
financial reporting frameworks. For example, such changes may be recorded
as gain or loss or in other comprehensive income. Also, depending
on the applicable financial reporting framework, the whole financial
instrument or only a component of it (for example, an embedded derivative
when it is separately accounted for) may be required to be measured
at fair value. , "Valuation

guidance on valuation of financial instruments.

are repaid before others (subordinated debt). The rights of each class
of security holder to the cash flows, frequently referred to as the

        <para role="ps_para_number">The cash flows of an asset-backed security
may be affected by prepayments of the underlying collateral and potential
default risk and resulting estimated loss reserves. Prepayment assumptions,
if applicable, are generally based on evaluating market interest rates
for similar collateral to the rates on the collateral underlying the
security. For example, if market interest rates for mortgages have
declined, then the underlying mortgages in a security may experience
higher prepayment rates than originally expected. Estimating potential
default and loss reserve involves close evaluation of the underlying
collateral and borrowers to estimate default rates. For example, when
the underlying collateral comprises residential mortgages, loss reserves
may be affected by estimates of residential housing prices over the
term of the security.</para>

in order to obtain fair value information. The preparation of an entityâ€™s
financial statements, including the valuation of financial instruments
and the preparation of financial statement disclosures relating to
these instruments, may require expertise that management does not
possess. Entities may not be able to develop appropriate valuation
techniques, including models that may be used in a valuation, and
may use a third-party pricing source to arrive at a valuation or provide
disclosures for the financial statements. This may particularly be
the case in smaller entities or entities that do not engage in a high
volume of financial instrument transactions (for example, nonfinancial
institutions with treasury departments). Even though management has
used a third-party pricing source, management is ultimately responsible
for the valuation and establishing internal control over the valuation

often performing daily valuations of large numbers of financial instruments.
These valuations may be made by collecting market data and prices
from a wide variety of sources, including market makers, and, in certain
instances, by using internal valuation techniques to derive estimated
fair values. Pricing services may combine a number of approaches to
arrive at a price and are often used as a source of prices based on

process for customers to challenge the prices received from the pricing
services. These challenge processes usually require the customer to
provide evidence to support an alternative price, with challenges
categorized based on the quality of evidence provided. For example,
a challenge based on a recent sale of that instrument the pricing
service was not aware of may be upheld, whereas a challenge based
on a customerâ€™s own valuation technique may be more heavily scrutinized.
In this way, a pricing service with a large number of leading participants,
both buy and sell side, may be able to constantly correct prices to
more fully reflect the information available to market participants.</para>

consensus pricing services, which differ from other pricing services.
Consensus pricing services obtain pricing information about an instrument
from several participating entities (subscribers). Each subscriber
submits prices to the pricing service. The pricing service treats
this information confidentially and returns to each subscriber the
consensus price, which is usually an arithmetical average of the data
after a data-cleansing routine has been employed to eliminate outliers.
For some markets, such as exotic derivatives, consensus prices might
constitute the best available data. However, many factors are considered

to support its valuation. In particular, this may be the case if the

          Because brokers provide quotes only as
an incidental service for their clients, quotes they provide differ

about which a pricing service may not be aware. Broker quotes may
be executable or indicative.  are a brokerâ€™s best estimate of fair value, whereas an executable
quote shows that the broker is willing to transact at this price.
Executable quotes are strong evidence of fair value. Indicative quotes
are less so because of the lack of transparency into the methods used
by the broker to establish the quote. In addition the rigor of controls
over the brokersâ€™ quote often will differ depending on whether the
broker also holds the same security in his or her own portfolio. Broker
quotes are often used for financial instruments with level 3 inputs

        Understanding the effect of credit risk
is an important aspect of valuing both financial assets and liabilities.
This valuation reflects the credit quality and financial strength
of both the issuer and any credit support providers. In some financial
reporting frameworks, the measurement of a financial liability assumes
it is transferred to a market participant at the measurement date.
When an observable market price for a financial liability does not
exist, its value is typically measured using the same method a counterparty
would use to measure the value of the corresponding asset, unless
there are factors specific to the liability (such as third-party credit
enhancement). In particular, the entityâ€™s own credit risk can often be difficult to measure.
