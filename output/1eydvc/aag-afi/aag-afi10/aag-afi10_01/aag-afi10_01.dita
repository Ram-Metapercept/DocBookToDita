  <para role="ps_para_number">In this case study, the entity has issued
a fixed-rate bond and is exposed to the risk that changes in the benchmark
interest rate will change the bondâ€™s fair value. In order to mitigate
this risk, the entity enters into an interest rate swap that effectively
converts the fixed-rate liability into a variable-rate liability.</para>
