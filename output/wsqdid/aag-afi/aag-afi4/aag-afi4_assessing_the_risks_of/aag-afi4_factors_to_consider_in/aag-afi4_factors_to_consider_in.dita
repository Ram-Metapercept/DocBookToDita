    <para role="ps_para_number">An expectation that controls are operating
effectively may be more common when dealing with an entity with well-established
controls; therefore, testing controls may be an effective means of
obtaining audit evidence. When an entity has a trading function, substantive
procedures alone may not provide sufficient appropriate audit evidence
due to the volume of contracts and the different systems used. Tests
of controls, however, will not be sufficient on their own because
the auditor is required by paragraph .18 of AU-C section 330B to design
and perform substantive procedures for all relevant assertions related
to each material class of transactions, account balance, and disclosure.</para>

    <para role="ps_para_number">When an entity has relatively few transactions
involving financial instruments, it may be relatively easy for the
auditor to obtain an understanding of the entityâ€™s objectives for
using the financial instruments and the characteristics of the instruments.
In such circumstances, much of the audit evidence is likely to be
substantive in nature; the auditor may perform the majority of the
audit work at year-end; and third-party confirmations are likely to
provide evidence in relation to the completeness, accuracy, and existence
of the transactions. </para>
