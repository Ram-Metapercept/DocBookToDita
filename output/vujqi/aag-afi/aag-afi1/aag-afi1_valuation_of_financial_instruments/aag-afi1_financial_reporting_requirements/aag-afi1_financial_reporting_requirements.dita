    <para role="ps_para_number">In many financial reporting frameworks,
financial instruments, including embedded derivatives, are often measured
at fair value for the purpose of balance sheet presentation, calculating
gain or loss, or disclosure. In general, the objective of fair value
measurement is to arrive at the price at which an orderly transaction
to sell an asset or transfer a liability would take place between
market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions
(that is, at an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective
of the market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability).
In meeting this objective, all relevant available market information
is taken into account.</para>

      Fair value measurements of financial assets
and liabilities may arise both at the initial recording of transactions
and later when there are changes in value. Changes in fair value measurements
that occur over time may be treated in different ways under different
financial reporting frameworks. For example, such changes may be recorded
as gain or loss or in other comprehensive income. Also, depending
on the applicable financial reporting framework, the whole financial
instrument or only a component of it (for example, an embedded derivative
when it is separately accounted for) may be required to be measured
at fair value. , "Valuation
of Financial Instruments," of this guide provides further detailed
guidance on valuation of financial instruments.

      Some financial reporting frameworks establish
a fair value hierarchy to develop increased consistency and comparability
in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The inputs may be classified into different levels, such
as

        <para>FASB ASC 820-10-35-37 notes that the fair value hierarchy categorizes

fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets

as a financial instrument moves from level 1 to level 2 or level 2
to level 3. Also, within level 2, there may be a wide range of measurement
uncertainty depending on the observability of inputs, the complexity

      Paragraphs 5â€“20 of FASB ASC 820-10-55
describe the use of present value techniques to measure fair value.
Those paragraphs neither prescribe the use of a single specific present
value technique nor limit the use of present value techniques to measure
fair value to the techniques discussed therein.  (that is, an application of the income approach)
is a tool used to link future amounts to a present amount using a
discount rate. A fair value measurement of an asset or a liability
