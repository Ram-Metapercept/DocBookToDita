  <para role="ps_para_number">Regardless of the valuation method used
(including those investments reported based on an investeeâ€™s financial
results), applicable financial reporting frameworks may require recognizing
in earnings an impairment loss for a decline in fair value that is
other than temporary. Determining whether losses are other than temporary
often involves estimating the outcome of future events. Accordingly,
judgment is required in determining whether factors exist that indicate
that an impairment loss has been incurred at the end of the reporting
period. These judgments are based on subjective, as well as objective,
factors, including knowledge and experience about past and current
events and assumptions about future events. The following are examples
of such factors:</para>
