  <para role="ps_para_number">As a practical matter, a type 1 or type
2 report is an efficient way for a user auditor to gain an understanding
of the service organizationâ€™s controls over the services provided
by the service organization; obtain information that will enable the
user auditor to assess the risk of material misstatement for assertions
about financial instruments; and, for a type 2 report, determine whether
