    To account for a derivative as a hedge,
FASB  (ASC) 815 requires management, at the inception of the hedge, to
designate the derivative as a hedge and contemporaneously formally
document the hedging relationship, the entityâ€™s risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, and the method of
assessing the effectiveness of the hedge. In addition, to qualify
for hedge accounting, FASB ASC 815 requires that management have an
expectation, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing
basis, that the hedging relationship will be highly effective in achieving
the hedging strategy.
