  <para role="ps_para_number">Financial instruments may have the associated
risk that a loss might exceed the amount, if any, of the value of
the financial instrument recognized on the balance sheet. For example,
a sudden fall in the market price of a commodity may force an entity
to realize losses to close a forward position in that commodity due
to collateral, or margin, requirements. In some cases, the potential
losses may be enough to cast substantial doubt on the entityâ€™s ability
to continue as a going concern. The entity may perform sensitivity
analyses or value-at-risk analyses to assess the future hypothetical
effects on financial instruments subject to market risks. However,
value-at-risk analysis does not fully reflect the extent of the risks
that may affect the entity; sensitivity and scenario analyses also
may be subject to limitations.</para>
