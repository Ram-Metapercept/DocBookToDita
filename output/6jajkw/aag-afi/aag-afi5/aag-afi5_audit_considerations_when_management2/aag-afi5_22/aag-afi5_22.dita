  <para role="ps_para_number">When there is a lack of observable external
evidence, it is particularly important that those charged with governance
have been appropriately engaged to understand the subjectivity of
managementâ€™s valuations and the evidence that has been obtained to
support these valuations. In such cases, it may be necessary for the
auditor to evaluate whether there has been a thorough review and consideration
of the issues, including any documentation, at all appropriate management
levels within the entity, including with those charged with governance.</para>
