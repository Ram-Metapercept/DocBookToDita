    Understanding the effect of credit risk
is an important aspect of valuing both financial assets and liabilities.
This valuation reflects the credit quality and financial strength
of both the issuer and any credit support providers. In some financial
reporting frameworks, the measurement of a financial liability assumes
it is transferred to a market participant at the measurement date.
When an observable market price for a financial liability does not
exist, its value is typically measured using the same method a counterparty
would use to measure the value of the corresponding asset, unless
there are factors specific to the liability (such as third-party credit
enhancement). In particular, the entityâ€™s own credit risk can often be difficult to measure.
