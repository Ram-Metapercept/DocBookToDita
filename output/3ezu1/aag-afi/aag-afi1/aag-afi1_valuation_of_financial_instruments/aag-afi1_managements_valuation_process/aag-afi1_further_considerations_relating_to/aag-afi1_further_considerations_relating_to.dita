    <para role="ps_para_number">Understanding how the pricing sources
calculated a price enables management to determine whether such information
is suitable for use in its valuation, including as an input to a valuation
technique and in what level of inputs the security should be categorized
for disclosure purposes. For example, third-party pricing sources
may value financial instruments using proprietary models, and it is
important that management understands the methodology, assumptions,
and data used.</para>

    <para role="ps_para_number">Disparities may exist between price indicators
from different sources. Understanding how the price indicators were
derived and investigating these disparities assists management in
corroborating the evidence used in developing its valuation of financial
instruments in order to evaluate whether the valuation is reasonable.
Simply taking the average of the quotes provided without doing further
research may not be appropriate because one price in the range may
be the most representative of fair value, and this may not be the
average. To evaluate whether its valuations of financial instruments
are reasonable, management may</para>

10 years as an indicator). Care is needed to ensure that extrapolation
is not carried so far beyond the observable curve that its link to
observable prices becomes too tenuous to be reliable.</para>
