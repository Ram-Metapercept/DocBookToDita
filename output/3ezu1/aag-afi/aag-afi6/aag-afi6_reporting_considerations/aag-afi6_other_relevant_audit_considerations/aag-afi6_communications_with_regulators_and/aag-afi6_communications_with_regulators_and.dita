      In some cases, auditors may be required, or may consider it appropriate, to communicate directly
with regulators or others, in addition to those charged with governance,
regarding matters relating to financial instruments. Such communication
may be useful throughout the audit. For example, when required to
communicate with banking regulators, such regulators may share information
with the auditor about the operation and application of controls over
financial instrument activities, challenges in valuing financial instruments
in inactive markets, and compliance with regulations. This sharing
of information may be helpful to the auditor in identifying risks
of material misstatement.

          For example, AU-C section 250B, , requires auditors to determine whether there is a responsibility
to report identified or suspected noncompliance with laws and regulations
to parties outside the entity. In addition, requirements concerning
the auditorâ€™s communication to banking supervisors and others may
be established in many countries by law, supervisory requirement,
or formal agreement or protocol.
