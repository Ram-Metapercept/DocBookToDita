  <para role="ps_para_number">If a user entity uses the services of
one or more service organizations, and those services are part of
the user entityâ€™s information system for financial instruments, the
user auditor may be unable to sufficiently limit audit risk for the
completeness assertion with respect to financial instruments without
obtaining audit evidence about the operating effectiveness of controls
at the service organizations. Because derivatives transactions may
not require an initial exchange of tangible consideration, they may
not be recorded; therefore, testing reconciliations of information
provided by two or more service organizations may not sufficiently
limit audit risk for assertions about the completeness of derivatives.
Accordingly, the auditor may need to perform additional audit procedures
at the user entity to address completeness.</para>
