  <para role="ps_para_number">Management may engage a valuation specialist
from an investment bank, a broker, or another valuation firm to value
some or all of the entityâ€™s financial instruments. Unlike pricing
services and broker quotes, generally, the methodology and data used
are more readily available to management when it has engaged a specialist
to perform a valuation on its behalf. Even though management has engaged
a specialist, management is ultimately responsible for the valuation
used.</para>
