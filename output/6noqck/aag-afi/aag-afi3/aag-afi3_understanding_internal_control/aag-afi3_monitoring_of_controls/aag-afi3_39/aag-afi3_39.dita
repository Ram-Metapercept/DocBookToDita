  <para role="ps_para_number">In larger entities, sophisticated computer
information systems generally keep track of financial instrument activities
and are designed to ensure that settlements occur when due. More complex
computer systems may generate automatic postings to clearing accounts
to monitor cash movements, and controls over processing are put in
place with the objective of ensuring that financial instrument activities
are correctly reflected in the entityâ€™s records. Computer systems
may be designed to produce exception reports to alert management to
situations when financial instruments have not been used within authorized
limits or when transactions undertaken were not within the limits
established for the chosen counterparties. However, even a sophisticated
computer system may not ensure the completeness of the recording of
financial instrument transactions. Accordingly, management frequently
puts additional procedures in place to increase the likelihood that
all transactions will be recorded.</para>
