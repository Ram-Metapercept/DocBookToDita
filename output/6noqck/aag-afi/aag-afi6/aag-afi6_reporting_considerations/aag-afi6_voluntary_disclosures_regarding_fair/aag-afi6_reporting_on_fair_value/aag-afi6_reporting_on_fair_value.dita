      Paragraph .19 of AU-C section 540B states
that the auditor should obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence
about whether the disclosures in the financial statements related
to accounting estimates are in accordance with the requirements of
the applicable financial reporting framework. The presentation of
financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting
framework includes adequate disclosure of material matters. The applicable
financial reporting framework may permit or prescribe disclosures
relating to accounting estimates, including fair value accounting
estimates, and some entities may disclose voluntarily additional information
in the notes to the financial statements. If such voluntary additional
information is presented as part of the basic financial statements,
in accordance with paragraph .59 of AU-C section 700B, , such information should be covered by the auditorâ€™s opinion if
it cannot be clearly differentiated.
