  <para role="ps_para_number">When an entity has relatively few transactions
involving financial instruments, it may be relatively easy for the
auditor to obtain an understanding of the entityâ€™s objectives for
using the financial instruments and the characteristics of the instruments.
In such circumstances, much of the audit evidence is likely to be
substantive in nature; the auditor may perform the majority of the
audit work at year-end; and third-party confirmations are likely to
provide evidence in relation to the completeness, accuracy, and existence
of the transactions. </para>
