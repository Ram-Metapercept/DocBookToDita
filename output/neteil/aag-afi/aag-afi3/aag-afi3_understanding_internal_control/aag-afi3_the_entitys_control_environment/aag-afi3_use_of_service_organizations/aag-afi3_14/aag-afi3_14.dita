    Entities may use service organizations
(for example, asset managers) to initiate the purchase or sale of
financial instruments, maintain records of transactions for the entity,
or value financial instruments. Some entities may be dependent on
these service organizations to provide the basis of reporting for
the financial instruments held. However, if management does not have
an understanding about the controls in place at a service organization,
the auditor may not be able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit
evidence to rely on controls at that service organization. AU-C section
402B, , establishes requirements
for the auditor to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence when
an entity uses the services of one or more service organizations.  provide further
guidance about the use of a service organization.
