  <para role="ps_para_number">Reconciliation and confirmation controls
may be automated, and if so, adequate IT controls need to be in place
to support them. In particular, controls are needed to ensure that
data is completely and accurately picked up from external sources
(such as banks and custodians) and from the entityâ€™s records and that
it is not tampered with before or during reconciliation. Controls
are also needed to ensure that the criteria on which entries are matched
are sufficiently restrictive to prevent inaccurate clearance of reconciling
items.</para>
