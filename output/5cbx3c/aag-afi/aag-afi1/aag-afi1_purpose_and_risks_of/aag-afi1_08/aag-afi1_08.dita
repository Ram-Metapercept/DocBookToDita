risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial
loss to another party by failing to discharge an obligation, and it
is often associated with default. Credit risk includes counterparty
risk and settlement risk, which are defined as follows:

the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will

currency risk, interest rate risk, and other price risk.

     Operational risk relates to the specific processing required for
financial instruments. Operational risk may increase as the complexity
of a financial instrument increases, and poor management of operational
risk may increase other types of risk. Operational risk includes the

a contract after the end user has delivered funds or assets according
to its obligations. Settlement risk relates almost solely to over-the-counter
(OTC) contracts (that is, nonexchange-traded instruments). One method
for minimizing settlement risk is to enter into a master netting agreement
that allows the parties to offset all their related payable and receivable
positions at settlement.
