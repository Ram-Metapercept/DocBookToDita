  <para role="ps_indent_0">The allowance for credit losses for purchased
available-for-sale debt securities with a more-than-insignificant
amount of credit deterioration since origination is also determined
in a similar manner to other available-for-sale debt securities. However,
ASU No. 2016-13 requires an entity to add the initial allowance for
credit losses to the purchase price, rather than reporting it as a
credit loss expense. Entities record only subsequent changes in the
allowance for credit losses as a credit loss expense. Furthermore,
an entity should recognize interest income based on the effective
interest rate, excluding the discount embedded in the purchase price
that is attributable to the acquirerâ€™s assessment of credit losses
at acquisition.</para>
